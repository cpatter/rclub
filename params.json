{"name":"Rclub","tagline":"","body":"Rclub is a ragtag gaggle of psycholinguists from the University of Potsdam, Germany. We meet up to discuss R, sharing tips, problems, recent code victories and (occasional) defeats. Sometimes we even talk about statistics. We usually meet in the PRIM ~~dungeon~~ laboratory. If you want to come, drop us a line, and bring chocolate.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
